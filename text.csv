2014-06-30,21,55,38,<porton>,I write a new specification based on RDF. Which of RDF serialization formats should be RDF examples be in?
2014-06-30,21,56,05,<porton>,Currently all my examples are in RDF/XML. Should I rewrite into an other format?
2014-06-30,21,56,32,<warp>,porton: I expect that depends on your audience :)
2014-06-30,21,57,08,<porton>,warp: The audience is programmers of various levels (both implementers and users of my system should be able to program)
2014-06-30,21,57,31,<warp>,"porton: I personally prefer turtle or json-ld, but that's just because I am more familiar with those."
2014-06-30,21,58,13,<porton>,"warp: Honestly, I know only RDF/XML. I can study other formats, but don't know whether it's worth. Are there advantages of turtle or json-ld?"
2014-06-30,21,58,25,<porton>,"By the way, this is my project: http://freesoft.portonvictor.org/namespaces.xml"
2014-06-30,21,58,41,<warp>,"porton: right, I don't mean just the programmers working with your system, but also the tools they use.  If someone has a setup where they are already dealing with RDF/XML from other sources, obviously working with RDF/XML will be convenient for them."
2014-06-30,21,59,44,<porton>,warp: Only developers of my system (currently myself) need to parse RDF. Ordinary users of my system however need to write RDF
2014-06-30,21,59,46,<warp>,porton: especially for documentation I think turtle is more readable for readers who are familiar with RDF.  json-ld may be easier for readers familiar with json and not familiar with RDF.
2014-06-30,22,01,08,<Anchakor>,"porton: most people really dislike rdf/xml, and prefer turtle"
2014-06-30,22,01,21,<porton>,"warp: So, is your advise to rewrite all examples in Turtle?"
2014-06-30,22,01,59,<porton>,Does Turtle has rdf:Seq support?
2014-06-30,22,02,45,<porton>,"By the way, are there other widespread RDF parsing tools except of librdf?"
2014-06-30,22,02,48,<Anchakor>,all rdf serializations support all of rdf
2014-06-30,22,03,25,<porton>,Should I learn only Turtle? Any other useful formats?
2014-06-30,22,04,16,<warp>,"porton: I think you should at least look into what JSON-LD is, it's getting fairly popular.  Even if you don't end up using it is valuable to know about it :)"
2014-06-30,22,05,17,<Anchakor>,best would be if you had something like the owl primer document has - option to toggle visibility of various syntaxes
2014-06-30,22,05,37,<porton>,warp: I don't see any advantages of JSON-LD for me
2014-06-30,22,05,45,<porton>,Anchakor: How is it done? with JS?
2014-06-30,22,05,46,<tobyink_>,Anchakor: actually not all RDF statements can be represented in RDF/XML.
2014-06-30,22,05,56,<Anchakor>,porton: http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/#OWL_Syntaxes
2014-06-30,22,06,08,<tobyink_>,<http://example.com/1> <http://example.com/2> <http://example.com/3> .
2014-06-30,22,06,14,<porton>,tobyink_: I thought all can be represented in RDF/XML. Please a counterexample

2014-06-30,22,06,53,<tobyink_>,porton: The example above. The predicate URI <http://example.com/2> cannot be represented as an XML qname.
2014-06-30,22,07,25,<porton>,"tobyink_: Sorry, I'm confused. Why can't it be represented?"
2014-06-30,22,07,46,<porton>,tobyink_: gotcha
2014-06-30,22,08,14,<tobyink_>,"<ex:2 ex:xmlns=""http://example.com/"">"
2014-06-30,22,08,25,<porton>,Is it a good practice to write only RDF representable in RDF/XML?
2014-06-30,22,08,33,<tobyink_>,"But oops, ""ex:2"" is not valid according to XML namespaces."
2014-06-30,22,09,31,<tobyink_>,Generally speaking people avoid creating vocabularies/ontologies/schemas/whatever-we're-calling-them-this-week that include terms which cannot be legally represented in RDF/XML.

2014-06-28,06,45,02,<dprophit>,Well I'm reviewing a default template in prestashop. The price is wrapped within an offer schema
2014-06-28,06,48,38,<dprophit>,http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/2014Jan/0164.html I like this proposal for discount relationship

2014-06-28,06,51,04,<dprophit>,I'm not sure if the HTML5 <del> tag alone would give enough information for semantic relationship

2014-06-28,06,52,37,<dbu>,<del> element represents a removal from the document
2014-06-28,06,53,36,<dprophit>,Correct.
2014-06-28,06,54,02,<dbu>,<price><del>$24.95</del> $19.95</price> ?
2014-06-28,06,56,24,<dprophit>,let me pastebin. Hold on
2014-06-28,06,58,24,<dprophit>,http://pastebin.com/ity0pUYj is the current tagged release version snippet.

2014-06-28,07,00,29,<dprophit>,Line 29 is where I suggested to the project to use the <del> tag and remove CSS linethrough property.
2014-06-28,07,06,50,<dbu>,yeah del is a good replacement for css linethrough..
2014-06-28,07,07,10,<dbu>,probably not enough to describe the discounted price unless it's specified/adopted
2014-06-28,07,07,23,<dbu>,i am not an ontologist...
2014-06-28,07,11,03,<dbu>,as long as eveyrone buys everything at amazon/ebay/taobao it's just an academic exercise. maybe people would use DDG/google/yandex and start shopping at longtail stores after doing searches?
2014-06-28,07,11,30,<dbu>,~or emit discount-notices over streaming-GRaph networks.. with filter-pipelines of sale tastemakes etc
2014-06-28,07,11,49,<dbu>,someting simulating 1980s Canal sT in NYC would be ideal
2014-06-28,07,12,54,<dprophit>,It IS very difficult for solo's to compete with boxed retail
2014-06-28,07,13,28,<dbu>,longtail vendors.. become substores on amazon/ebay
2014-06-28,07,13,43,<dbu>,how do those stores handle metadata from 3rd parties? any schema.org use?
2014-06-28,07,14,31,<dprophit>,All depends upon the open source ecommerce project. There are amazon API's for merchant feed(s).
2014-06-28,07,15,43,<dprophit>,"So, therein lies the database abstraction to UX layout(s)"
2014-06-28,07,17,08,<dprophit>,Ebay has one of the sloppiest API documentation publications. Many go in circles with data that does not reflect current API fucntionality.
2014-06-28,07,17,19,<dbu>,microformats used oldschool HTML els as muchb as possible for metadata
2014-06-28,07,17,55,<dbu>,im not sure to what extent schema.org does that. in RDF it's extraordinarily rare you'd dig inside a RDF:HTML/XSD:XMLLiteral to look for something like <del>.
2014-06-28,07,19,35,<dprophit>,"<del> was the only thing I could think of to markup a slahed price. You may be right that it gives the wrong signal. The price is not removed. It's simply a new price specification. I already checked that schema, too. Might be relevant."
2014-06-28,07,20,18,<dbu>,"for one, if you're using schema.org as RDF predicates. or in JSON-LD, you might not even have <html5> els available"
2014-06-28,07,20,31,<dbu>,so you're limiting it to the microdata use-case
2014-06-28,07,22,15,<dbu>,the boolean 'on sale' flag seems reasonable
2014-06-28,07,22,24,<dbu>,"how you specify the original price, don't know"
2014-06-28,07,23,52,<dprophit>,I posted the topic at https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DenverProphitJr/posts/8zfj7Ev94MJ and Dan Brickley CC'd Professor Martin Hepp. *crossing fingers* I sure do want to help the prestashop community on this.
2014-06-28,07,23,57,<dbu>,"specifying <del>'s usage at a RDFa/Microdata level as somethng like ""This isn't captured into the derived graph, as it's an old value"" when used for rendering diffs/history though"
2014-06-28,07,25,10,<dbu>,"oh, danbri referred you here"
2014-06-28,07,25,20,<dbu>,is there a schema.org specific chan?
2014-06-28,07,25,38,<dbu>,it seems more active of a community than random abandonware schemas i've crawled offprefix.cc's list
2014-06-28,07,25,40,<dprophit>,First I found the channel via google search. Shared the w3 doc and Dan was the first to respond heh
2014-06-28,07,26,02,<dbu>,ok. i whoised danja or aaronsw or danc or danbri in #swhack in like 2001. and i saw #rdf-ig. then it changed names sometime
2014-06-28,07,26,12,<dbu>,"that and swh was using RDF in his LV2 audio plugins and was all ""what's this RDF thig...?"""
2014-06-28,07,27,05,<dprophit>,"Haven't found a schema.org specific channel, yet. I did find #microformats"
2014-06-28,07,27,12,<dbu>,in 1999 i worked on some product in sf called INTERSHOP. i thinkj i actually saw it still in use on sonystyle.com like last year
2014-06-28,07,28,34,<dprophit>,"My experience has been with osCommerce for the last 10 years. They're not very adaptive of structured data, yet. Prestashop holds promise... leading the way. The other leaders zen-cart, opencart, abantecart all do not compare"
2014-06-28,07,28,53,<dbu>,the GoodRelations pointer is good. BestBuy.com was using RDFa Afaik. maybe Walmart also
